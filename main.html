<h2>Explanation</h2>

<p><b>Domkol</b> is an HTML5/Javascript/SVG/Canvas/JQuery application I am developing which 
displays a complex function as a colouring of the complex plain (a technique
known as <b>domain colouring</b>), with additional interactivity to show values as a 
graph on a 1-dimensional subset of the domain (i.e. a 1-dimensional subset of the complex numbers
considered as a 2-dimensional Real number space). 
Right now, it is showing the function <b>f(z) = z<sup>3</sup></b>, with the origin in the centre, and 
the corners are 1+i, 1-i, -1+i and -1-i (with the origin in the centre).</p>

<p>The 1-dimensional curve showing is a circle. (Adding an option for viewing the values of the function
on a chosen straight line is on the to-do list.)</p>

<p>The circle is controlled by two draggable handles: a centre handle that moves the circle
as a whole, and an edge handle that controls the radius of the circle. The values of <b>f</b>
for values of <b>z</b> on the circle are shown
in terms of distance from the centre of the circle, where <b>f = 0</b> is on the circumference itself,
positive is outside the circle and negative is inside the circle. 
Real is black; imaginary is blue.
The scale of the mapping from the value of <b>f</b> to radius is controlled by the slider, which has
a logarithmic scale.</p>

<p>If the graph of <b>f</b> goes through
the centre, then the graph becomes ambiguous, and you should use the slider to reduce the scale factor.</p>

<h2>Issues and Browser Compatibility</h2>

<p>So far I have tested Domkol on the latest versions of various browsers, including:</p>

<ul>
 <li>In Linux (Ubuntu 12.10): Chromium, Chrome and Firefox. </li>
 <li>In Windows (Vista): Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Safari and Internet Explorer.</li>
</ul>

<p>I am using Chromium on Linux to develop the application, so at any particular time it is likely
to work most correctly on that browser.</p>

<p>Known issues are:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Performance: Now that I have set the 1-dimensional graph to calculate a new value of <b>f</b> 
roughly once per pixel in the domain curve, there are some noticeable performance variations between 
browers, especially when dragging the circle handles.
For example, Firefox on Linux is much "jumpier" than Chrome/Chromium on Linux. On Windows,
Chrome and Opera seem smooth, Safari, IE and Firefox seem a bit jumpy. This is just my experience &ndash; 
which almost certainly depends on specific details of my hardware setup and which operating systems I have installed.
You may have to experiment to determine which browser works best for you. (My immediate plans are that if it works
well on at least one browser, I prefer to concentrate on developing new functionality, rather than spending time optimising
for other browsers.)</li>
 <li>The handles and slider do not (yet) work on a touch screen. I tried 
<a href="http://touchpunch.furf.com/">Touch Punch</a>, which worked for the slider, but not very well for
the draggable handles.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>TL;DR:</b> Domkol works best with Chrome or Chromium on a desktop with a mouse.</p>
