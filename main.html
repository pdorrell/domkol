<h2>Explanation</h2>

<p><b>Domkol</b> is an HTML5/Javascript/SVG/Canvas/JQuery application I am developing which 
displays a complex function as a colouring of the complex plain (a technique
known as <b>domain colouring</b>), with additional interactivity to show values as a 
graph on a 1-dimensional subset of the domain (i.e. a 1-dimensional subset of the complex numbers
considered as a 2-dimensional Real number space). 
Right now, it is showing the function <b>f(z) = z<sup>3</sup></b>, with the origin in the centre, and 
the corners are 1+i, 1-i, -1+i and -1-i</p>

<p>The 1-dimensional curve showing is a circle. (Adding an option for viewing the values of the function
on a chosen straight line is on the to-do list.)</p>

<p>The circle is controlled by two draggable handles: a centre handle that moves the circle
as a whole, and an edge handle that controls the radius of the circle. The values of <b>f</b>
for values of <b>z</b> on the circle are shown
in terms of distance from the centre of the circle, where <b>f = 0</b> is on the circumference itself,
positive is outside the circle and negative is inside the circle. 
Real is black; imaginary is blue.
The scale of the mapping from the value of <b>f</b> to radius is controlled by the slider, which has
a logarithmic scale.</p>

<p>If the graph of <b>f</b> goes through
the centre, then the graph ceases to be ambiguous, and you should use the slider to reduce the scale factor.</p>

<h2>Issues and Browser Compatibility</h2>

<p>So far I have tested Domkol on the latest versions of various browsers, including:</p>

<ul>
 <li>In Linux (Ubuntu 12.10): Chromium, Chrome and Firefox. </li>
 <li>In Windows (Vista): Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Safari and Internet Explorer.</li>
</ul>

<p>I am using Chromium on Linux to develop the application, so at any particular time it is likely
to work most correctly on that browser.</p>

<p>Known issues are:</p>

<ul>
 <li>I haven't worked out how to increase the slider length.</li>
 <li>On Internet Explorer, the slider appears to the left instead of the right (but I haven't yet put it where I really want it, so this is not a big issue yet).</li>
 <li>The handles and slider do not (yet) work on a touch screen. I tried 
<a href="http://touchpunch.furf.com/">Touch Punch</a>, which worked for the slider, but not very well for
the draggable handles.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>TL;DR:</b> Domkol works with latest version of any major desktop web browser with a mouse.</p>
