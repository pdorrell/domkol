<h2>Explanation</h2>

<p><b>Domkol</b> is an HTML5/Javascript/SVG/Canvas/JQuery application I am developing which 
displays a complex function as a colouring of the complex plain (a technique
known as <b>domain colouring</b>), with additional interactivity to show values as a 
graph on a 1-dimensional subset of the domain (considered as a 2-dimensional Real number space). 
Currently it shows the function <b>f(x) = x<sup>3</sup></b>.</p>

<p>Currently the only choice of 1-dimensional subset (i.e. curve) is a circle &ndash;  
I will probably add an option for viewing the values of the function
on a chosen straight line.</p>

<p>The circle is controlled by two draggable handles: a centre handle that moves the circle
as a whole, and an edge handle that controls the radius of the circle. The values are shown
in terms of distance from the centre of the circle. Real is black; imaginary is blue.
The scale of the mapping from the value of <b>f</b> to radius is controlled by the slider, which has
a logarithmic scale.</p>

<h2>Issues and Browser Compatibility</h2>

<p>So far I have tested Domkol on the latest versions of various browser. The primary development browser
is currently Chromium on Linux.</p>

<p>Known issues are:</p>

<ul>
 <li>It works on Chromium and Chrome on Linux and Windows, also (mostly) Internet Explorer on Windows.</li>
 <li>I haven't worked out how to increase the slider length.</li>
 <li>On Internet Explorer, the slider appears to the left instead of the right.</li>
 <li>On Firefox (Windows or Linux), and Opera (Windows), the handles jump when dragging starts, making
the dragging not very useable.</li>
 <li>The handles and slider do not (yet) work on a touch screen. I tried 
<a href="http://touchpunch.furf.com/">Touch Punch</a>, which worked for the slider, but not very well for
the draggable handles.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>TL;DR:</b> it works best on Chrome/Chromium with a mouse.</p>
